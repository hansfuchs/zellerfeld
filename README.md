# Zellerfeld Challenge - X/Twitter Clone

A simple micro web app built as a hiring assignment.

Created by Hans Fuchs.

# How to try out the app online

Visit: https://zellerfeld.vercel.app/

How to create an account:

1. Click on "Sign Up" in the header
2. Create an account (use any email, any password) to receive a real confirmation link per email (10 minute mail should also work)
3. Confirm account creation by clicking the link from the email.

# How to run locally

1. Install [bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation)
2. Install [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
   a. if using podman, run: `export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/$(id -u)/podman/podman.sock`
   b. if on Macbook, run: `podman machine init`, then `podman machine start`
3. Run: `bun i`
4. Run: `bun supa:start`
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set the publishable key (seen in output from `bun supa:start`)
6. Run: `bun run dev`

# Architecture

## Tech Stack Overview

- React + Next.js
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- TailwindCSS
- Vercel (deployment)

## Frontend

- React + Next.js
- used SSR where possible

## Backend & API

- added basic REST API
- used Server Action for post creation
- PostgreSQL SQL functions

## DB

- Supabase + PostgreSQL
    - simple to setup, easy local development, nice migrations
    - only basic RLS setup to save time
        - ideally I would have used more SQL functions, both for performance and security reasons
- for a larger application I would use AWS Aurora + PostgreSQL

## Auth

- Supabase Auth
    - used to save time
- normally I would use BetterAuth/Auth0

# Quality Gates

- added basic linting, formatting, GitHub CI/CD
- added basic unit test to save time
    - normally I'd at least add integration tests for login, logout, etc. using MSW

# Deployment

- Vercel
    - for ease of use
    - I've set up an equivalent deployment workflow (+ preview deployments) completely on AWS before (using SST 3 with Pulumi), which was A LOT more work

# Features

I stuck to the assignment PDF, but since I've never actually used Twitter/X, please forgive me if I missed something obvious that you were expecting.

- [x] sign up
- [x] logout
- [x] login
- [x] profile view
    - [x] profile feed
- [x] creating a post
- [x] feed

Features I left out on purpose:

- avatar upload
    - I would have simply used S3 from Supabase for storage, there is no complexity worth showing here
- commenting (out of scope)
- liking/retweeting (out of scope)

# General Thoughts

While I haven't used React in over a year, I just felt like using it here.
I decided to first implement some basic authentication to get back into React a bit before I added the required features.

I worked on this challenge whenever I had some spare time in between handling my kids and my responsibilities as Tech Lead, so please disregard the git timestamps.
In total, I spent around 6h, including project setup and practice.

Additional caveats:

- I wrote everything from scratch on my own, not a single line of code generated by LLMs
    - While I do use Claude, it's exclusively for inspiration, advice, rubberducking, configuration files, and one-off scripts
    - Due to personal experience, I am strictly against fully agentic workflows or vibe coding for professional work that money depends on
- A non-exhaustive list of things missing/disregarded on purpose (in no particular order) due to time constraints; all of which I would usually spend much more time on:
    - React Query
    - integration & e2e tests
    - responsiveness (breakpoints etc.)
    - accessibility
    - semantic HTML
    - pagination/infinite scroll
    - proper timezone handling
    - advanced form validation (e.g. check if email is valid)
    - advanced error handling (e.g.: check if username already exists)
    - i18n
    - turborepo for a monorepo
    - advanced GitHub workflows
    - automatic versioning
    - dependabot
    - ...
- For my own convenience and to give just a rough idea of what an authentic work environment of mine looks like, I copied and adjusted the following things from my own code from other projects, even though they have no consequence on the assignment:
    - GitHub PR checks
    - prettier
    - oxlint
    - git hooks
